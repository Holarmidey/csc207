    <h4>What we do</h4>
    <p>Kwara state university is the university for community development. The University is designed to build on the historic and current strength while developing new areas and programmes that will take KWASU to greater heights.KWASUâ€™s strategic plan includes a framework of assessment of tools and metrics that will evaluate progress qualitatively and quantitatively. <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing</p>.
