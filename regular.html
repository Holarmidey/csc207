      <h4>About the program</h4>
        <p> Regular study is the key to a stress free life and is the best way to avoid last minute panic and rote learning. At times, regular studies, accompanied by regular assignments and class tests, may become hectic for students. <br> The way to streamline the process and to strike a balance is to simply make regular studies interesting in your own way. Here are some ways to keep your environment more conducive for studies, thus making it interesting, fun and fruitful at the same time: The first and foremost thing to be done is to create time-slots for each subject. This can be done based on the priority of the subject, its difficulty level, or the proximity of an exam for that specific subject. If a subject can wait for a day or two in your opinion, you may revisit it, thereby giving precedence to subjects that need immediate attention due to an approaching exam or a Q&A session at school. Once you have planned the subjects you will be studying on a particular day, the next thing you need to do is to make your surroundings comfortable and conducive for studies. It is very important that your room is well-lit and well ventilated for complete concentration.  <br><p>A physical card to hold and carry around will make it easy for you to memorise and retain the information much effectively. You may use it while you are in school or at home or even when you are engaged in some other activity. Last but not the least, put the technology you have access to, to the best use. Create an online study group to exchange notes with your peers. It may simply be a WhatsApp group or a group on any social media platform for you and your classmates to connect outside the classroom. It would help to keep the study points fresh in memory, the things you have learnt and also learn from others and understand their perspective towards the subject. Daily exchange of short notes and pointers, by the end of the day would come handy for everyone to have a quick recap of what was taught in class and stay updated all the time.</p>
